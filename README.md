# DifferentialEquations
🌊 Differential Equations Simulation Project

Interactive • Visual • Parametric • Python-powered

Welcome to the Differential Equations Simulation Suite — a collection of fun, interactive, visually rich simulations designed to bring classic differential-equation models to life.

This project shows how real mathematical models move, flow, oscillate, charge, and bend when you tweak their parameters. Everything runs inside a clean, unified Python environment with sliders, animations, and 3D graphics.

🎯 What This Project Includes

We simulate five of the most common and important systems in a Differential Equations course:

🧪 1. Mixed Tanks (Mixing Problems)

Simulates:

Concentration of salt over time

Inflow/outflow rates

Volume changes

Dynamic color changes so you see how concentration evolves

🕳️ 2. Draining Tanks (Torricelli-type models)

Simulates:

Height of the fluid as the tank drains

Faster/slower draining depending on the outlet size

Visible water level decreasing in real time

🔌 3. RLC Circuits

Simulates:

Charge and current over time

Underdamped, overdamped, critically damped behaviors

Little animated circuit elements so it feels alive

🌀 4. Spring–Mass System

Simulates:

Oscillations with or without damping

Stiffer springs, heavier masses

Real-time bouncing motion in 3D (yes, it looks cool)

🪵 5. Deflection of a Beam (Euler–Bernoulli model)

Simulates:

How a beam bends under different loads

Adjustable material/geometry parameters

Smooth deformation curves

🧰 Technologies Used

Everything is built in one unified environment, so all simulations feel part of the same project.

🔹 Python

The core of the project.
Used for solving ODEs (SymPy, SciPy) and handling the mathematical model behind each simulation.

🔹 VPython

Used for real-time 3D animations.
Perfect for tanks, springs, bouncing masses, and intuitive movement.

🔹 Matplotlib / Plotly

For dynamic 2D graphs when needed.

🔹 Pandas

For organizing parameters, outputs, tables, and experiment results.

🔹 Interactive Sliders (Streamlit)

The secret ingredient.
Each simulation comes with smooth, friendly sliders that let you adjust:

Initial conditions

Physical constants

Input/output flow rates

Resistances, capacitances, inductances

Mass, damping, stiffness

Beam properties
…and immediately see what changes.

🎛️ How It Works

Choose a simulation from the menu
